# Ted Fried's MicroCore Labs Projects

My blog which has some details on these projects: www.MicroCoreLabs.Wordpress.com

My YouTube Channel with some videos of the stuff in action: www.youtube.com/channel/UC9B3TaEUon-araO2j7tp9jg/videos


Boards:

	MCL86jr -  IBMPCjr Accelerator which boosts performance to IBM PC/AT speed
    MCL65+ - MOS 6502 emulator which runs on a Teensy 4.1 and can be used as a 6502 drop-in replacment
	MCL64  - MOS 6510 emulator which runs on a Teensy 4.1 and can be used as a drop-in replacment in the Commodore 64

	
Emulated Processors:

	MCL68  - Motorola 68000 Emulator written in C
    RISCV  - Simple and compact RISC-V RS32I implementation written in C
    MCL65  - MOS 6502 written in C


Microsequencer-based processors: 

    MCL65 - MOS 6502 
    MCL51 - Intel 8051
    MCL86 - Intel 8086/8088
    
Other processors:

    MCLR5 - Quad-Issue Superscalar RISCV
    Lockstep Quad Modular Redundant System 
    
Misc:

    Wheelwriter  - FPGA based Printer Option for the IBM Wheelwriter 5
    Wheelwriter2 - Arduino Leonardo based Printer Option for the IBM Wheelwriter 5
	Brother Typewriter - Arduino Leonardo converts Serial RX to a Brother Word Processor
	EPROM Emulator - Small PCB which uses Teensy 4.0 to emulate up a 64KB 27C512 EPROM
